# OBJECT_DETECTION-AND-DISTANCE-MEASUREMENT

Pre-trained weights objects are being detected from live video frame along with the
measurement of the object from the camera without the support of any extra hardware
device.In this object detection from video frame in any video file or in a image,Counting the
number of objects in a frame and measuring the distance of object using depth information.It
has been used which is able to detect 80 different objects .Some of those are person,car,bus
backpack and so on .From the initial part we understood that, to measure distance from an
image we to localize it first to get the depth information.
It can be used for robotic application ,to detect different
object around and it can also calculate distance from it to the object.If we are using an audio
translator,then it is also helpful for blindâ€™s to find an object and to know about the distance.
